[Laws.Africa](https://laws.africa) endeavours to facilitate African governments in offering sustainable, free access to dependable digital laws. It aims to achieve this by ensuring that the laws are easily accessible, user-friendly, educational, and reusable. This initiative seeks to empower citizens with knowledge of their legal rights and obligations while promoting transparency and accountability within the legal system. Laws.Africa offers a content application programming interface (API) to fetch legislative content and metadata. The API is a read-only API for listing and fetching published versions of legislative works. This package interfaces with this API to allow access using R.

## What does `africalaws` do?

Please note that `africalaws` is still highly experimental and is undergoing a lot of development. Hence, any functionalities described below and in the rest of the package documentation have a high likelihood of changing interface or approach as we aim for a stable working version.

Currently, the package provides functions for:

* Authenticating with the Laws.Africa API;
* Performing a call to the `countries` API endpoint; and,
* Performing a call to the `works` API endpoint.

From here, the plan is to continue developing functions that wrap the various available [API endpoints](https://developers.laws.africa/api/about-the-api).

## Installation

`africalaws` is not yet on CRAN but can be installed from the [Oxford IHTM R universe](https://oxfordihtm.r-universe.dev) as follows:

```{r install-r-universe, eval = FALSE}
install.packages(
  "africalaws",
  repos = c('https://oxfordihtm.r-universe.dev', 'https://cloud.r-project.org')
)
```

## Usage

The following vignettes describe how to use the `africalaws` package.

* Authenticating with the Laws.Africa API

* Listing out countries and areas/locations with available works from the Laws.Africa API

* Listing out works for a specific country or areas/locations that are available from the Laws.Africa API
