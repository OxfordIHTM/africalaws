Description: Laws.Africa <https://laws.africa> endeavours to facilitate African 
    governments in offering sustainable, free access to dependable digital laws. 
    It aims to achieve this by ensuring that the laws are easily accessible, 
    user-friendly, educational, and reusable. This initiative seeks to empower 
    citizens with knowledge of their legal rights and obligations while 
    promoting transparency and accountability within the legal system. 
    Laws.Africa offers a content application programming interface (API) to 
    fetch legislative content and metadata. The API is a read-only API for 
    listing and fetching published versions of legislative works. This package 
    interfaces with this API to allow access using R.
